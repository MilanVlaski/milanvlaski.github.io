*   Software Craftsman
*   Full Stack Developer
*   I like Simple Software

### Brief Technical History

My particular interest for software engineering was sparked
during my third year at a University for Electrical Engineering, when,
on a software project, I discovered a part of my personality
that is goal seeking, focused and fearless. I also gained a persistent
source of motivation, in the knowledge that my software *can* impact people's lives.

**Java** was the largest part of this chapter.
It was Test Driven Development that helped raise me up from a total beginner, to a
useful programmer. Later, I learned a few JVM-based backend frameworks, along with Linux and Bash
fundamentals for deploying and managing web services.

I've always enjoyed user interface work, but avoided it on the web, until I decided to get better
at semantic HTML, and CSS. *Currently*, I'm reverse-engineering
[shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) a component library so I can more easily
create UIs that contain clean and maintainable HTML and CSS. I use Vanilla Javascript, as I love
the [architectural freedom](/writing/vanilla_js_architecture) it offers.

*Currently*, I'm trying to carve my own path as a programmer, always trying to see for myself
whether a particular idea, or technology is based in truth, or not.

## Life interests

I enjoy writing essays, and bodybuilding. I play an MMORPG called Albion Online. I like to cook for myself and loved ones.
