    description: Offline-first web apps for field work, narrative-driven landing pages for small businesses, and lightweight system reverse-engineering.
---

1. Creating offline-first web apps to eliminate data loss in the field. For foresters or gym owners. **PWA, Offline-First.**
2. Building narrative driven landing pages to win more customers. For small businesses moving online. **Landing page, SEO**.
3. Reverse-engineering existing systems into more reliable and lightweight versions - whether you're stuck with an existing tool, or need a custom alternative.

## Offline-first Apps

Stop worrying about Wi-Fi. I build Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) designed specifically for entry with **greasy fingers** 😅, or away from internet.

Your data is saved locally first and syncs when you’re back online. No lost progress and no "spinning wheels".

[Example]({{ "/projects" | locale_url }}#workout_logger)

## Landing Pages

Narrative-driven conversion. Transitioning your small business online shouldn't feel like shouting into a void. I combine brand strategy with high-conversion landing pages.

I've successfuly gained connections, and attracted customers and clients with my methods, and I'm willing to teach you how. It's  a simple matter of being honest, believing in what you say and presenting it without noise. Based on that, we will work together in these steps: 
1. Step 1 - Describe your product/service convincingly.
2. Step 2 - Define the core message.
3. Step 3 - Decide the (social) media for the message.

[Example]({{ "/projects" | locale_url }}#etickethub)

## Reverse Engineering

If your current software feels like a chore, let’s replace it. If you see a piece of software, and wish you had it, we can work together to create it from scratch, and make it even lighter than the original!

Perfect for government or small businesses stuck in "Excel Hell" or bloated SaaS subscriptions. Save hours of frustration by using a tool built exactly for your workflow.
