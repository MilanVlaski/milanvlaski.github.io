Hi! I'm Milan Vlaški, a programmer. You might care to check out my:

*   [My Services]({{"/writing/my_work" | locale_url }})

## Technical interests

I have a background in Java and Kotlin, as well as HTML, CSS and Javascript, with some Linux and Bash. I'm a full-stack developer, who likes simple software.

I'm a minimalist. This results in:
- Software that works **without intervention** for many years. In 2026 this is rare <!-- TODO prove that static sites last long -->
- Software with a smaller physical footprint, and fewer lines to read.
- Saving time and money when writing and running code.
  
Naturally, it's no good to be minimalistic in all circumstances. Nevertheless, minimalism is a common thread in my life, ever since I was young. It combines well with "going under the radar", offering many strategic advantages.

### Brief Technical History

My particular interest for software engineering was sparked
during my third year at a University for Electrical Engineering, when,
on a software project, I discovered a part of my personality
that is goal seeking, focused and fearless. I also gained a persistent
source of motivation, in the knowledge that my software *can* impact people's lives.

**Java** was the largest part of this chapter.
It was Test Driven Development that helped raise me up from a total beginner, to a
useful programmer. Later, I learned a few JVM-based backend frameworks, along with Linux and Bash
fundamentals for deploying and managing web services.

I've always enjoyed user interface work, but avoided it on the web, until I decided to get better
at semantic HTML, and CSS. *Currently*, I'm reverse-engineering
<a href="https://shoelace.style" target="_blank">shoelace</a> a component library so I can more easily
create UIs that contain clean and maintainable HTML and CSS. I use Vanilla Javascript, as I love
the [architectural freedom]({{"/writing/vanilla_js_architecture" | locale_url }}) it offers.

*Currently*, I'm trying to carve my own path as a programmer, always trying to see for myself whether something is necessary, or not.

## Life interests

I enjoy writing essays, and bodybuilding. I play an MMORPG called Albion Online. I like to cook for myself and loved ones.
