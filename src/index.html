        <h3>Brief Technical History</h3>
        <p>
            My particular interest for software engineering was sparked
            during my third year at a University for Electrical Engineering, when,
            on a software project, I discovered a part of my personality 
            that is goal seeking, focused and fearless. I also gained a persistent
            source of motivation, in the knowledge that my software <i>can</i> impact people's lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Currently</i>, I'm trying to carve my own path as a programmer, always trying to see for myself 
            whether a particular idea, or technology is based in truth, or is based on a lie.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Life interests</h2>
        <p>I enjoy writing essays, and bodybuilding. I play an MMORPG called Albion Online. I like to cook for myself and loved ones.</p>
