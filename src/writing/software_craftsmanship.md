title: Software Crafstmanship
---

Hand crafted software is not possible to do with AI.
A crafstman has too much pride. Even ego.
A craftsman is different from an engineer in very specific ways. An software engineer tries to apply known scientific, or known best practices, to the software that they build. However, best practices are a joke.
