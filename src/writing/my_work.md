title: How I Can Help You
---

1. Creating offline-first web apps to eliminate data loss in the field. For field-based industries, like foresters or gym owners. **PWA, SPA, Offline-First.**
2. Building narrative driven landing pages to win more customers. For small businesses moving online. **Landing page, SEO**.
3. Reverse-engineering existing systems into more reliable and lightweight versions - whether you're stuck with an existing tool, or need a custom alternative.

## Offline-first Apps
**Focus**: Reliability in any environment. Stop worrying about Wi-Fi. I build Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) designed specifically for heavy data entry and field work.

**The Value**: Your data is saved locally first and syncs when you’re back online. No lost progress, no "spinning wheels," just pure productivity.

## Landing Pages
**Focus**: Narrative-driven conversion. Transitioning your small business online shouldn't feel like shouting into a void. I combine brand strategy with high-conversion landing pages.

**The Value**: I build a digital storefront that speaks your language and turns casual visitors into loyal customers.

## Reverse Engineering
**Focus**: If your current software feels like a chore, let’s replace it. If you see a piece of software, and wish you had it, we can work together to create it from scratch, and make it even lighter than the original!

**The Value**: Perfect for government or small businesses stuck in "Excel Hell" or bloated SaaS subscriptions. Save hours of frustration by using a tool built exactly for your workflow.
