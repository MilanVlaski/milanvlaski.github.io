title: What I can do for you
---

1. Create offline-first web apps to save time during data entry. For gym owners, foresters or similar. **PWA, SPA, Offline-First.**
2. Helping you with a marketing strategy, with crisp landing pages, to increase outreach and customers. For small businesses looking to go online. **Landing page, SEO**.
3. Reverse-engineering existing annoying systems you use day to day, or are interested in owning, and creating more reliable, lightweight versions - to save time. For industry, or businesses managing content.

## 1. The "Field-Ready" App
**Focus**: Reliability in any environment. Stop worrying about Wi-Fi. I build Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) designed specifically for heavy data entry and field work.

The Value: Your data is saved locally first and syncs when you’re back online. No lost progress, no "spinning wheels," just pure productivity.

**Best For**: Offline-First needs, PWA, and Data Integrity. [Example](/projects#workout_logger)

## 2. The "Brand-to-Build" Strategy
**Focus**: Narrative-driven conversion. Transitioning your small business online shouldn't feel like shouting into a void. I combine brand strategy with high-conversion landing pages.

**The Value**: I don't just write copy; I build a digital storefront that speaks your language and turns casual visitors into loyal customers.

**Best For**: Landing Pages, Brand Voice, and Strategic Growth. [Example](/projects#etickethub)

## 3. The "System Overhaul"
**Focus**: Trimming the fat from bloated software. If your current software feels like a chore, let’s replace it. I reverse-engineer clunky, "annoying" legacy systems into lightweight, custom alternatives.

**The Value**: Perfect for government or small businesses stuck in "Excel Hell" or bloated SaaS subscriptions. Save hours of frustration by using a tool built exactly for your workflow.

**Best For**: Custom Tools, Process Optimization, and Lightweight UX.
