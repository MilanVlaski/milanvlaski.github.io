title: Basic software

Basic web = HTML, CSS, JS. Basic DB: SQL, usually Postgres. Basic hosting. SSH, Linux, Bash.
Why learn 50 different frameworks, requiring a documentation dive, and many new concepts each time, for a new proejct, when foundational protocols and platforms, like the browser, HTTP, Linux, SSH, are there, working, and will always keep working, requiring zero updates, zero breaking changes, and most importantly - [zero need to learn](/writing/i_don't_have_a_passion_for_learning).
