I went to school. Indeed. You learn something new every year. Then you recite the knowledge. Then you forget?

> The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.

It's a waste of time to learn new things, if you NEVER apply them, only recite them. Because then, you get good at reciting only. The same way that programmers do for job interviews.
