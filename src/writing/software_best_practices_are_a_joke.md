title: Software best practices are a joke
---

This text contains a list of software best practices that are either inconsistent, not objective, or not useful, thus proving that **software best practices are a joke**.

<!-- The main reason may be that programmers have no taste, or, are not artistic enough, but that's just a dumb opinion. It's better to list the examples of best practice: -->
- Is TDD good or bad? Some good programmers are for it, some are against it.
- Hexagonal architecture is a good thing. Ok, how is it defined? The author Alistair Cockburn, believes that Hexagonal helps in isolating the code from the "framework" letting the framework affect the runtime, but not the logic of the system. (See link from LinkedIn article, endorsed by Cockburn himself). Yet, apparently Spring Boot follows the hexagonal architecture?
- Java is considered an object oriented programming language. For reasons why that is not so, see [James Coplien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbuXxB7j260), [Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/09/10/anti-patterns-in-oop.html) or [David West](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Thinking-Developer-Reference-David/dp/0735619654).
- React is the most popular frontend framework.
