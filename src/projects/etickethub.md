Used in German transport **today**, this system issues tickets, and provides them to customers on a mobile app. Serves dozens of Public Transport Operators, and their customers.
- I broke down a legacy monolithic backend into microservices.
- Integrated *Motics* on the backend - allowing tickets to be
bound to customer devices, preventing theft.
- Tested critical business logic, with end to end tests and
unit tests.
- Integrated with Google Wallet, allowing customers to hold tickets in a familiar app.
- Overhauled the styling for a demo shop, to show new features to future clients.
- Created short videos for social media, and a landing page to display demos, showcasing the entire team's work.
